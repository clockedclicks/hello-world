HAVE NO FEAR, BEACAUSE I AM HERE!

Thanks for reading my readme, I'm a cyber operations student at Dakota State University and this is my first time using github. Currently I'm reading Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking by Georgia Weidman.

I love anime so you may read a lot of anime quotes as well as other quotes from movies or shows I'm into, why you ask, because Goonies never say die that's why!
